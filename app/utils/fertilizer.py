        <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:

        <br/><br/> 1. <i>Increase Carbon-Rich Organic matter: </i> – Add carbon-rich materials such as straw, sawdust, or wood chips to balance the nitrogen content.

        <br/> 2. <i>Avoid Nitrogen Fertilizer: </i> – Stop using nitrogen-based fertilizers and option for phosphorous or potassium-focused fertilizers.

        <br/>3. <i>Plant heavy nitrogen consuming plants: </i> – Plant heavy nitrogen consuming plants like Corn, Tomatoes, Cabbage or leafy greens.  

        <br/>4. <i>Reduce Irrigation: </i> – Limit excessive watering, which can cause nitrogen leaching.""",

        <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:
        <br/><br/> 1. <i>Apply Nitrogen-rich Fertilizers: </i> – Use nitrogen-rich fertilizers such as urea,ammonium nitrate, or composed manure to supplement soil nitrogen levels.

        <br/>2. <i>Utilize Organic Matter: </i> – Incorporate organic matter such as compost or aged manure into the soil to improve soil structure and increase nitrogen availability.

        <br/>3. <i>Optimize Irrigation: </i> – Manage irrigation practices to avoid leaching of nitrogen from soil.

        <br/>4. <i>Apply Nitrogen at the Right Time: </i> – Apply nitrogen rich fertilizers at critical growth stages of crops, such as during early vegetative growth or before fruit set.""",

        <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:

        <br/>1. <i>Use only phosphorus-free fertilizer: </i> – Find a fertilizer with numbers such as 10-0-10, where the zero represents no phosphorous.

        <br/>2. <i>Water your soil: </i> – Soaking your soil liberally will aid in driving phosphorous out of the soil.

        <br/>3. <i>Plant Nitrogen Fixing vegetables: </i> Plant nitrogen fixing vegetables to increase nitrogen without increasing phosphorous (like beans and peas).

        <br/>4. <i>Crop Rotation: </i> Use crop rotations to decrease high phosphorous levels.""",

        'Plow': """The P value of your soil is low.
        <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:

        <br/>1. <i>Phosphorus Fertilizers: </i> – Applying a fertilizer with a high phosphorous content in the NPK ratio (example: 10-20-10, 20 being phosphorous percentage).

        <br/><br/>2. <i>Bone meal: </i> – A fast acting source that is made from ground animal bones which is rich in phosphorous.

        <br/>3. <i>Organic compost: </i> – Adding quality organic compost to your soil will help increase phosphorous content.

        <br/>4. <i>Clay soil: </i> – Introducing clay particles into your soil can help retain & fix phosphorus deficiencies.""",

        'KHigh': """The K value of your soil is high.
        <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:

        <br/><br/>1. <i>Loosen the soil: </i> Deeply with a shovel, and water thoroughly to dissolve water-soluble potassium. Allow the soil to fully dry, and repeat digging and watering the soil two or three more times.

        <br/>2. <i>Remove rocks from the soil: </i> Remove as many rocks as possible, Minerals occurring in rocks such as mica and feldspar slowly release potassium into the soil.

        <br/>3. <i>Add calcium rich elements: </i> Mix crushed eggshells, crushed seashells, wood ash or soft rock phosphate to the soil to add calcium. Mix in up to 10 percent of organic compost to help amend and balance the soil.

        <br/>4. <i>Use Low K level fertilizers: </i> Use NPK fertilizers with low K levels and organic fertilizers since they have low potassium values.""",

        'Klow': """The K value of your soil is low.
        <br/>Please consider the following suggestions:

        <br/><br/>1. <i>Burry Banana Peels: </i> Bury banana peels in the soil near plants to slowly release potassium as they decompose.
        <br/>2. <i>Raise pH value: </i> Sprinkle wood ash around plants to supply potassium and raise soil pH simultaneously.
        <br/>3. <i>Spread Crushed Pumpkin seeds: </i> Spread crushed pumpkin seeds as mulch around plants to enrich the soil with potassium and other nutrients.
        <br/>4. <i>Use Potash Fertilizer: </i> Use Potash fertilizers since they contain high values potassium."""
