# Krishi Tech: A complete Cropping System

## Overview
Krishi Tech is an all-in-one agricultural platform designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in optimizing their crop production. It offers crop recommendations, fertilizer suggestions, and a plant disease detection system based on leaf images. This project leverages machine learning and data analysis to provide accurate and actionable insights to improve crop yield.

## Features

- Crop Recommendation: Suggests the best crops to plant based on soil conditions(N,P,K,pH), climate, and other environmental factors.
- Fertilizer Recommendation: Provides suggestions for the types of fertilizers to use for different crops, enhancing growth and yield.
- Leaf Disease Detection: Utilizes image recognition to detect diseases from plant leaf images, helping farmers to take timely action to protect their crops.
